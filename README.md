 
Reminder Bot
--------

A simple twitter bot that direct messages a user reminders based off data in an excel sheet. In the future it should be
capable of taking commands, updating its status, updating the excel sheet, etc. For now it's a novelty that helps me
structure my day better.

Getting Started
---------------

To run your own instance of this project, clone this repository and set up environment variables on your system that hold 
the access token and customer keys necessary for an application like this to work.

For this project to work you will need to install node. For it to reliably work for extended periods of time, it needs to be
hosted somewhere beyond your local machine, preferably via a free cloud-based PaaS.

Built With
---------

- Node.js runtime environment
- MS Excel
- Heroku cloud PaaS

Acknowledgments

Egghead.io's 'Build a Twitter Bot with node.js' that introduced me to the twitter api and some of its appications.
